# TravelTrucks: Camper Rental Service 🚐
This project is a web application for a camper rental service, designed to provide a seamless experience for users to browse, review, and book campers. The application features multiple pages and offers a user-friendly interface to manage camper listings.

## 🚐 Features:

- Individual Camper Pages: Each camper has its own dedicated page, which includes customer reviews, detailed specifications, and a booking form.
- Review System: Users can leave and read reviews for each camper to help others make informed decisions.
- Booking Functionality: A simple and intuitive booking form is available on each camper’s page, making the reservation process quick and easy.
- Dynamic Filters: Users can filter campers by different criteria (e.g., location, price, availability) to find the perfect option.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- React: For building the user interface and managing the state of the application.
